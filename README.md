For my project I decided to make the topic Nintendo and Mario because it is one of my favorite video game companies. The index page simply lists many characters that are usually with Mario in Nintendo games. The second page lists Mario games, the console it was on, and when it was released. The third page lists Nintendo consoles in order of when they were released. The fourth page lists Nintendo consoles as well as how many hardware/software units were sold. My stylesheet0 page contains the styling for the pages as well as a translation of the scss code from that page. I had to manually translate it through a website because my command panel didn't allow me to translate it.
